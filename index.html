      var whole_heart = "\“Don’t look away.\” That\’s what she told me many years ago, her hands cupping my face and her thumbs pressing into the soft give beneath my ears, bright black eyes boring into mine. Her fingers were soft and still wet red. \“Don’t look back.\” It is dawn when I go to the abode of the Empress, after the gongs sing in terrifying synchronization to herald the crash of day upon night. It\’s ritual to listen with closed eyes, to imagine each resonant thrum as a footstep of the sun god striding across the sky. Only a few stragglers remain outside, mostly tired lamplighters at the end of their night-long shift; they clutch their poles to their chest and breathe in with closed eyes as the gongs\’ notes quiver in the cold morning air, basking in the heralding of the sun and the ending of the lamplighting. I can see the relief in their faces; they\’re already dreaming of sleep as they flip around the poles so it is not the lit wick but the snuffer, capping and smothering the flames of the lanterns, plunging the immediate area into darkness before dawn breathes rosy light back into the shadows. I follow the cobblestone road in this fluctuating illumination, knowing I\’ll eventually find myself at the gates.	 Normally—normally I am asleep at this time, tucked between a blanket of cats and my mattress. My days are repetitive and dull, a wanderer of the streets and an avoider of any others. Today, however, I woke up with a crinkle, a letter under my pillow with a name on it (the wrong name): delivery orders from my master. And so, my feet slide along the slippery stones, damp from night showers—dragging, dragging, unwilling to find myself at the destination. But, in defiance of my begrudging will, the gates come into view and I stop. The last time I saw them, they were smoking and in ruins, relics from a different past, a different dynasty. It\'s been difficult to return back to the gates, my memories too fresh and then too old, and for many years I\’ve skirted around them. I give them a half-mile radius of avoidance so they remain blocked by the tall city roofs—out of sight, out of mind. How proudly the paifangs stand in front of me now, red columns and beams topped with black multitiered roofs so clean and well-maintained that they look freshly constructed. The calligraphy gleams lurid gold at me, and the guards do not blink as I pass; I let out a breath as I cross over, nerves knotting in my throat. (One of the calligraphic symbols promised chastity over widowhood. I couldn\’t help but huff a laugh.) Any amusement I have is swallowed by trepidation as I enter the courtyard, slickly clean rock underneath. I walk through, dazed. It is far more opulent than I remember; after years of nothing but drab gray, she must\’ve become overly fond of garish decoration. But there is meticulous care as well: the plants are carefully groomed, far removed from the sprawling overgrowth of the past. There is enough of the old courtyard—the same structure, the same choice of stone and wood—that I am caught, tilting on the axis of reality and that of fiction, dizzied as I stand in front of the courtyard\’s central sculpture. Before I realize it, my hands are reaching out to settle on terracotta folds of a robe finally suitable for the Empress. She stands above me, young and tall and powerful, and behind her is her army of three—the soldier, General Tzao who defected and swore his loyalty to her; the scribe, Nian, who wrote the legislation that changed everything before he left the empire in the capable hands of the Empress; the maid Mei, demurely looking down and holding the sheath of the knife that killed the Emperor. The last, an unknown figure to most. Right before the Emperor\’s daughter drew her dagger to murder him, he knew. Something about her demeanor, something about the guards on shift on that particular day, all of it led to his shrewish, clever brain piecing it all together and before the Empress\’s stroke fell, he twisted away and unsheathed his own dagger in response. But his stroke missed, instead striking deep in the breastbone of the maid. In the first days of the Empress\’s reign, it must\’ve been hectic, full of scholar-officials and the ministries clamoring for stability. No time for the burying of a simple maid, but you could slip in an homage to a shadow-lass while constructing a statue to commemorate your rise to power. I don\’t look much at the general or the scribe or the maid, however—I look instead at the Empress, at her fierce gaze, and then I move on. The courtyard, after such close examination, looks a little gray. Now that I have stepped foot back into the courtyard, my curiosity is voracious after years of suppressed memories; I am desperate to see what changes time has wrought on old haunts. I pass through the kitchen, walking among the many maids flitting in and out of its smoky interior, and see the chefs murmuring to each other about what to cook for the day. \“What does it matter, when it all gets sent back anyway?\” exclaims one, throwing down his knife down on his cutting board among the colorful array of vegetables, pale with worry. I take a deep whiff of expensive spices, a hint of saffron eminent, and then back out of the kitchen. The hallway corridors are starting to get unfamiliar, memory masked by new gilt and jewels, but my feet remember the way to the Empress\’s rooms. One of the palace cats—too clean to be a stray cat wandering—twines its way around my ankles with a little purr, probably smelling the scent of a thousand other cats on me. Even before, I always liked cats, but now I take strength from their all-too-knowing sight. It\’s positively shaking from the tremulous force of its purr and I pet it idly before abandoning its warmth to push through the heavy wooden doors protecting the Empress\’s inner chambers. She has many—antechamber after antechamber, each lushly furnished as if their purpose was decoration rather than intimidation. I walk past maids with their heads ducking down and tear tracks scrubbed away from their faces, and I slip through the final set of doors without alarming a single soul. The bedchamber beyond is impeccable, the knickknacks polished to perfection by maids who have nothing else to do other than clean. The windows are open, but it is a breezeless day and the heavily embroidered curtains did not move. All is still, except for the slow rising and falling of the blankets. The letter slip from my fingers, corporeal, to the blankets, and she stirs. Her official name is now Empress Dao-Ming, Empress of the Shining Path, but I knew her back when she was Chun, daughter of the Emperor, a man who strew blood and bone over the city cobblestone until the rivers ran red with blood. Ever since she rose to power, they have remained clean—shiningly clean—reflecting her fastidious immaculacy; she cannot bear to be dirty, after spending so many years smeared by his bloody fingers. She is older now, her dear face twisted and creased from sleep, but eyes lucidly clear. She looks first at the letter, opening it with her trembling brown-spotted hands. And her brows furrow quizzically at the writing on the page—first, her Empress name, my master\’s strong-stroked script crossed out but still legible. Then, in my messier scrawl, right next to the scribbled out name, the simple characters of her name—not Empress Dao-Ming, but Chun—and then finally, finally, she looks up. She cannot see me—not yet—and instead she looks back down at the letter. For a long moment, she stares. I can see the furrow in her brow as her mind works to summon up memories of events long past. \“Ach,\” she says, pressing fingers to her temple. \“I must be going mad, for this handwriting—\” “\You\’re not mad,\” I whisper, and she looked around with a confused frown, probably hearing something as insubstantial as the buzzing of a fat honeybee. \“It\’s mine. My handwriting.\” I reach out to touch her hand but my fingers slide through hers. At my touch, she shivers violently and draws the blankets around her tighter, withdrawing. I bite down on my lip, retreating, and wait, even though it is so—so difficult. I didn\’t realize it would be like this—I thought, perhaps, after so long, I would be used to the sight of her—that since she was older, maybe my heart wouldn\’t beat away in my chest in a fluttering fervor. She\’s muttering to herself. \“It couldn\’t be, though. And where did it come from?\” She flings aside the blanket and carefully slides out of bed, still clutching the letter. Atop quivering feet, she creaks over to the large rosewood desk at the far side of the room, settlings into the well-cushioned chair with a long groan of bones adjusting to a new position. I follow, curious, and watch as she draws forth a necklace tucked under her clothing, a key—a tiny gold thing—at the end, which fits into an almost-imperceptible keyhole at the side of the desk. A little twist, and a small drawer pops open. Inside of it are small objects: her seal, her father\’s seal, and a small letter. I know the first as well as I know the second, and I know the last better. She takes the letter from the drawer and deposits it onto the desk, beside the other letter. I know the handwriting will be the same, but I hear her sharp intake as she compares and realizes the truth—that every stroke is the same, down to the overly long diagonal strokes. She turns around, and she sees me, finally. That\’s usually the first sign. And her eyes widens at the sight of me, the gaping wound still weeping on my chest, endless. I am not like most spirits, who upon death adapt the form from when they are most happy and hale—the hole in my chest refuses to heal, an unceasing reminder of that day and of my unfulfilled duty. \“Mei,\” she whispers, choked. \“My empress.\” \“Mei,\” she repeats and laughs, covering her face a little, as if I am not so familiar with her face that I cannot see the little, telling convulsion of her body as she tries not to cry. People describe her face as mask-like sometimes, when they were trying to negotiate with her, balking at the expressionless demeanor she affects. But I know her laugh, know her cries; we ran together, as small children, and lay together as grown women. And so, even though my fingers itch to reach out to her and hold her, I instead kneel, bowing my head. \“It is my duty,\” I say, \“to tell you—inform you my appearance means—\” \“Please,\” she says. \“I know what this means.\” And there is nothing but joy in her voice. When I stand, she does too, rising away from her body, which is still slumped in the chair with hands covering her face.  When I died, I was told that my duty was yet to be completed and I would remain on the mortal plane until it was done. And I knew—I\’ve always known—that my duty was to my Empress, my Chun. Call it fidelity to my country and its ruler, call it love, it\’s all the same to me in the end; it all ties back to the wound on my chest, endlessly weeping, perpetually longing. In the interim, I\’ve spent my time helping people move from life to afterlife. When I guided General Tzao, who had wept at the sight of me, he had looked older than I remembered but younger than the age of his death; it was the age, he told me, when his daughters were ten and eleven and he and his wife were at their happiest. Nian, when I recovered him from his country estate of retirement, was fat and indulgently pleased with the life he had built and the works he\’d written; he looked exactly the same after death as during. Though they are clothed as they take my hand and let me guide them across, the moment of death is more naked than nudity, a soul\’s detachment baring the last moment of true happiness in a person\’s life.  And so it does not surprise me, but it moves me nearly to tears when I see that she\’s the same age as me, the same age as when I died and we slipped out of each others\’ grasps. \“Come,\” I say, holding out my hands and this time, when she slides her slender hands into mine, I can feel them. I squeeze her hands once and she squeezes back, her smile irrepressible. We walk down the stairs together, through the courtyard, where I pause by the terracotta statue for a second. I say, because I cannot keep my mouth shut when faced with its ridiculous glory, \“This was unnecessary.\” \“Don\’t tell me what statues I can have in my courtyard,\” she says with a beautiful scowl, and my heart aches. \“Tzao and Nian approved of it.\” \“Of course they did.\” I laugh and then wince at the sound, hoarse from disuse. It\’ll have more practice, later; I am not worried about prolonged solitude anymore. We continue walking on the slippery stones that no longer pose a danger to her youthful hips, servants and other palace people rushing past us, the most powerful woman in the world unseen by everyone around other than me. Even as children, I knew she was destined for greatness. \“Don\’t look away from me, Chun,\” I say, catching her wide black gaze, as I lead her through the paifang, past the guards who cannot see us any longer. I can see her being tempted, piqued by the resounding wail that begins to rise from the palace as some unlucky servant stumbles across the Empress\’s corpse, the sound of grieving. But when her gaze wavers, curious for one last glance at what was her home for many decades, I tell her, pleadingly—\“Don\’t look back,\” thinking please, you\’ll only see what you have here, and she doesn\’t, hands in mine as we step across the gate and cross once more, into a city that is no longer hers. I can feel my chest throbbing and she reaches out to touch the closing hole, smiling, smiling, as we pass beyond.";
